# lepto-hybrid-model

Code and data for the manuscript submitted to *PLOS Computational Biology* titled:  
**"Hybrid neuralâ€“mechanistic modeling of leptospirosis transmission with environmental drivers: Evidence from Thailand"**

---

## Overview

This repository contains the code, data, and reproducibility files for running the hybrid modeling framework developed in the study. The model combines neural network components (LSTM) with a mechanistic SIR-based ODE system, incorporating environmental covariates such as rainfall, temperature, and water indices to simulate and forecast leptospirosis transmission dynamics.
